# ðŸ“‚ Data Folder  

This folder is for **raw datasets** (e.g., `train.csv`).  
To keep the repository lightweight, raw data files are **not tracked in Git**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Place your local training data here before running the app.

### Example files:
- train.csv â€” your full local dataset (NOT tracked in Git)
- sample_data.csv â€” tiny demo data included for quick runs / CI
